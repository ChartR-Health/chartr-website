<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and its implementing regulations, provides
restrictions on the use and disclosure of protected health information
(PHI).</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>This policy specifies the responsibilities, requirements, and

regulated by HIPAA, on behalf of a covered entity, involving the
creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission (i.e., use and
disclosure) of PHI (including claims processing or administration, data
analysis, processing or administration, utilization review, quality
assurance, patient safety activities listed at 42 CFR 3.20, billing,
benefit management, practice management, and repricing); or</p></li>
<li><p>Provides legal, accounting, actuarial, consulting, data

individual maintained by or for the Plan; or</p></li>
<li><p>Other protected health information used, in whole or in part, by
or for the Plan to make coverage decisions about an individual.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disclosure.</em> For information that is PHI, disclosure means
any release, transfer, provision of access to, or divulging in any other
manner of individually identifiable health information to persons not
employed by or working within the human resources department of the
location(s) of the Employer.</p>

benefits and adjudication or subrogation of health benefit
claims;</p></li>
<li><p>risk adjusting based on enrollee status and demographic
characteristics; and</p></li>

<p>Chartr Health will, to the extent possible, mitigate any harmful
effects that become known to it of a use or disclosure of an
individual’s PHI in violation of HIPAA or the policies and procedures
set forth in this Policy. As a result, personnel will immediately
contact the Privacy Official for the appropriate steps to mitigate the
harm to impacted individuals, if the member becomes aware of:</p>

<p>No individual will be required by Chartr Health or any of its members
to waive his or her privacy rights under HIPAA, as a condition of
treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility under a health plan.</p>
<p><strong>Policy and Procedures for Use and Disclosure of
PHI</strong></p>
<p><strong>Compliance</strong></p>
<p>All members of Chartr Health with access to PHI must comply with this
Policy and included procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Access to PHI Is Limited to Certain Employees</strong></p>
<p>The following employees (“employees with access”) have access to
PHI:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any employee who performs functions directly on behalf of Chartr
Health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[Insert title(s), if applicable]; and,</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Any other employee who has access to PHI on behalf of the
Employer for its use in “plan administrative functions”. This
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[Inset title(s), if applicable]</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Employees with access may use and disclose PHI for company
administrative functions, and they may disclose PHI to other employees
with access for administrative functions (but the PHI disclosed must be
limited to the minimum amount necessary to perform the plan
administrative function). Employees with access may not disclose PHI to
employees (other than employees with access) unless an authorization is
in place or the disclosure otherwise is in compliance with this Policy
and any associated procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Permitted Uses and Disclosures for Plan Administration
Purposes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chartr Health may disclose the following for its use:</p></li>
<li><p>(a) de-identified health information;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) Enrollment information;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) summary health information for the purposes of obtaining
premium bids for providing health insurance coverage under a plan or for
modifying, amending, or terminating the plan; or,</p></li>
<li><p>(d) PHI pursuant to an authorization from the individual whose
PHI is disclosed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PHI may be disclosed to the following employees who have access to
use and disclose PHI to perform functions on behalf of Chartr Health or
to perform plan administrative functions (“employees with access”):</p>
<p><strong>Permitted Uses and Disclosures: Payment and Health Care
Operations</strong></p>
<p>PHI may be disclosed for the purposes of Chartr Health’s own payment
purposes, and PHI may be disclosed to another covered entity for the
payment purposes of that covered entity. Same stands for disclosure for
health care operations. PHI may be disclosed to another covered entity
for purposes of the other covered entity’s quality assessment and
improvement, case management, or health care fraud and abuse detection
programs, if the other covered entity has (or had) a relationship with
the participant and the PHI requested pertains to that relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uses and Disclosures for Chartr Health's Own Payment Activities
or Health Care Operations. An employee may use and disclose PHI to
perform the Chartr Health’s own payment activities or health care
operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disclosures must comply with the "Minimum-Necessary” Standard.
(Under that procedure, if the disclosure is not recurring, the
disclosure must be approved by the Privacy Official.)</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Disclosures for Another Entity's Payment Activities. An employee
may disclose PHI to another covered entity or health care provider to
perform the other entity's payment activities. These disclosures will be
made according to procedures developed by the Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures for Certain Health Care Operations of the Receiving
Entity. An employee may disclose PHI for purposes of the other covered
entity's quality assessment and improvement, case management, or health
care fraud and abuse detection programs, if the other covered entity has
(or had) a relationship with the individual and the PHI requested
pertains to that relationship. Such disclosures are made according to
procedures developed by the Privacy Official.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The disclosure must be approved by the Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must comply with the “minimum-Necessary
Standard.”</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for “Documentation Requirements.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Use or Disclosure for Purposes of Non-Health Benefits. Unless an
authorization from the individual (as discussed in "Disclosures Pursuant
to an Authorization") has been received, an employee may not use a
participant's PHI for the payment or operations of the Employer's
"non-health" benefits (e.g., disability, worker's compensation, and life
insurance). If an employee requires a participant's PHI for the payment
or health care operations of non-Plan benefits, follow the steps
provided by the Privacy Official.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obtain an Authorization. First, contact the Privacy Official to
determine whether an authorization for this type of use or disclosure is
on file. If no form is on file, request an appropriate form from the
Privacy Official. Employees shall not attempt to draft authorization
forms. All authorizations for use or disclosure for non-Plan purposes
must be on a form provided by (or approved by) the Privacy
Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions? Any employee who is unsure as to whether a task he or
she is asked to perform qualifies as a payment activity or a health care
operation of the Plan should contact the Privacy Official or his or her
designated representative.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No Disclosure for Non-Health Plan Purposes</strong></p>
<p>PHI may not be used or disclosed for the payment or operations of the
Chartr Health’s “non-health” benefits (e.g., disability, workers’
compensation, life insurance, etc.), unless the participant has provided
an authorization for such use or disclosure (as discussed in
“Disclosures Pursuant to an Authorization”) or such use or disclosure is
required by applicable state law and particular requirements under HIPAA
are met.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Disclosures: Individual and HHS</strong></p>
<p>A participant’s PHI must be disclosed as required by HIPAA in three
situations: (1) The disclosure is to the individual who is the subject
of the information (see the policy for “Access to Protected Information
and Request for Amendment” that follows); (b) the disclosure is required
by law; or, (c) the disclosure is made to HHS for purposes of enforcing
HIPAA.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Request From Individual. Upon receiving a request from an
individual (or an individual's representative) for disclosure of the
individual's own PHI, the employee must follow the procedure for
"Disclosures to Individuals Under Right to Access Own PHI."</p></li>
<li><p>Request From HHS. Upon receiving a request from a HHS official
for disclosure of PHI, the employee must take the steps established by
the Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the procedures for verifying the identity of a public
official set forth in "Verification of Identity of Those Requesting
Protected Health Information."</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permissive Disclosures: Legal and Public Policy
Purposes</strong></p>
<p>An employee who receives a request for disclosure of an individual's
PHI that appears to fall within one of the categories described below
under "Legal and Public Policy Disclosures Covered" must contact the
Privacy Official. Disclosures must: (1) be approved by the Privacy
Official; (2) comply with the “Minimum-Necessary Standard”; and, (3) be
documented in accordance with the procedure for “Documentation
Requirements”. Permitted disclosures include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disclosures about victims of abuse, neglect or domestic violence,
if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The individual agrees with the disclosure; or</p></li>
<li><p>The disclosure is expressly authorized by statute or regulation
and the disclosure prevents harm to the individual (or other victim) or
the individual is incapacitated and unable to agree and information will
not be used against the individual and is necessary for an imminent
enforcement activity. In this case, the individual must be promptly
informed of the disclosure unless this would place the individual at
risk or if informing would involve a personal representative who is
believed to be responsible for the abuse, neglect or violence.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For Judicial and Administrative Proceedings, in response to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An order of a court or administrative tribunal (disclosure must
be limited to PHI expressly authorized by the order); and</p></li>
<li><p>A subpoena, discovery request or other lawful process, not
accompanied by a court order or administrative tribunal, upon receipt of
assurances that the individual has been given notice of the request, or
that the party seeking the information has made reasonable efforts to
receive a qualified protective order.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To a Law Enforcement Official for Law Enforcement Purposes, under
the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pursuant to a process and as otherwise required by law, but only
if the information sought is relevant and material, the request is
specific and limited to amounts reasonably necessary, and it is not
possible to use de-identified information.</p></li>
<li><p>Information requested is limited information to identify or
locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness or missing person.</p></li>
<li><p>Information about a suspected victim of a crime (1) if the
individual agrees to disclosure; or (2) without agreement from the
individual, if the information is not to be used against the victim, if
need for information is urgent, and if disclosure is in the best
interest of the individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Information about a deceased individual upon suspicion that the
individual's death resulted from criminal conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Information that constitutes evidence of criminal conduct that
occurred on the Employer's premises.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To Appropriate Public Health Authorities for Public Health
Activities.</p></li>
<li><p>To a Health Oversight Agency for Health Oversight Activities, as
authorized by law.</p></li>
<li><p>To a Coroner or Medical Examiner About Decedents, for the purpose
of identifying a deceased person, determining the cause of death or
other duties as authorized by law.</p></li>
<li><p>For Cadaveric Organ, Eye or Tissue Donation Purposes, to organ
procurement organizations or other entities engaged in the procurement,
banking, or transplantation of organs, eyes or tissue for the purpose of
facilitating transplantation.</p></li>
<li><p>For Certain Limited Research Purposes, provided that a waiver of
the authorization required by HIPAA has been approved by an appropriate
privacy board.</p></li>
<li><p>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety, upon a belief in
good faith that the use or disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious
and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the
public.</p></li>
<li><p>For Specialized Government Functions, including disclosures of an
inmate’s PHI to correctional institutions and disclosures of an
individual's PHI to an authorized federal Official for the conduct of
national security activities.</p></li>
<li><p>For Workers' Compensation Programs, to the extent necessary to
comply with laws relating to workers' compensation or other similar
programs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosures Pursuant to an Individual
Authorization</strong></p>
<p>PHI may be disclosed for any purpose if an authorization that
satisfies all of HIPAA’s requirements for a valid authorization is
provided by an individual. All uses and disclosures made pursuant to a
signed authorization must be consistent with the terms and conditions of
the authorization.</p>
<p>Any requested disclosure to a third party (i.e., not the individual
to whom the PHI pertains) that does not fall within one of the
categories for which disclosure is permitted or required in this policy
may be made pursuant to an individual authorization. If disclosure
pursuant to an authorization is requested, the following procedures
should be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
<li><p>All uses and disclosures made pursuant to an authorization must
be consistent with the terms and conditions of the
authorization.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the authorization form is valid. Valid authorization
forms are those that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are properly signed and dated by the individual or the
individual's representative;</p></li>
<li><p>Are not expired or revoked [the expiration date of the
authorization form must be a specific date (such as July 1, 2010) or a
specific time period (e.g., one year from the date of signature), or an
event directly relevant to the individual or the purpose of the use or
disclosure (e.g., for the duration of the individual's
coverage)];</p></li>
<li><p>Contain a description of the information to be used or
disclosed;</p></li>
<li><p>Contain the name of the entity or person authorized to use or
disclose the PHI;</p></li>
<li><p>Contain the name of the recipient of the use or
disclosure;</p></li>
<li><p>Contain a statement regarding the individual's right to revoke
the authorization and the procedures for revoking authorizations;
and</p></li>
<li><p>Contain a statement regarding the possibility for a subsequent
re-disclosure of the information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Follow the procedures for verifying the identity of the
individual (or individual's representative) set forth in "Verification
of Identity of Those Requesting Protected Health Information."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verification of Identity of Those Requesting Protected Health
Information</strong></p>
<p>Employees must take steps to verify the identity of individuals who
request access to PHI. They must also verify the authority of any person
to have access to PHI, if the identity or authority of such person is
not known. Separate procedures are set forth below for verifying the
identity and authority, depending on whether the request is made by the
individual, a parent seeking access to the PHI of his or her minor
child, a personal representative, or a public official seeking
access.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Request Made by Individual.</strong> When an individual
requests access to his or her own PHI, the following steps should be
followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Request a form of identification from the individual. Employees
may rely on a valid driver’s license, passport or other photo
identification issued by a government agency.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the identification matches the identity of the
individual requesting access to the PHI. If you have any doubts as to
the validity or authenticity of the identification provided or the
identity of the individual requesting access to the PHI, contact the
Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a copy of the identification provided by the individual and
file it with the individual's designated record set.</p></li>
<li><p>If the individual requests PHI over the telephone, ask for his or
her social Security number.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Request Made by Parent Seeking PHI of Minor
Child.</strong> When a parent requests access to the PHI of the parent's
minor child, the following steps should be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek verification of the person's relationship with the child.
Such verification may take the form of confirming enrollment of the
child in the parent's plan as a dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
"Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Request Made by Personal Representative.</strong> When a
personal representative requests access to an individual's PHI, the
following steps should be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Require a copy of a valid power of attorney or other
documentation—requirements may vary state-by-state. If there are any
questions about the validity of this document, seek review by the
Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a copy of the documentation provided and file it with the
individual's designated record set.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Request Made by Public Official.</strong> If a public
official requests access to PHI, and if the request is for one of the
purposes set forth above in "Mandatory Disclosures of PHI" or
"Permissive Disclosures of PHI," the following steps should be followed
to verify the official's identity and authority:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the request is made in person, request presentation of an
agency identification badge, other official credentials, or other proof
of government status. Make a copy of the identification provided and
file it with the individual's designated record set.</p></li>
<li><p>If the request is in writing, verify that the request is on the
appropriate government letterhead.</p></li>
<li><p>If the request is by a person purporting to act on behalf of a
public official, request a written statement on appropriate government
letterhead that the person is acting under the government's authority or
other evidence or documentation of agency, such as a contract for
services, memorandum of understanding, or purchase order, that
establishes that the person is acting on behalf of the public
official.</p></li>
<li><p>Request a written statement of the legal authority under which
the information is requested, or, if a written statement would be
impracticable, an oral statement of such legal authority. If the
individual's request is made pursuant to legal process, warrant,
subpoena, order, or other legal process issued by a grand jury or a
judicial or administrative tribunal, contact the Legal
Department.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain approval for the disclosure from the Privacy
Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Requests for Disclosure of PHI From Spouses, Family
Members, and Friends.</strong> PHI will not be disclosed to family or
friends of an individual except as required or permitted by HIPAA.
Generally, an authorization is required before another party, including
spouse, family member or friend, will be able to access PHI.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If an employee receives a request for disclosure of an
individual's PHI from a spouse, family member or personal friend of an
individual, and the spouse, family member, or personal friend is either
(1) the parent of the individual and the individual is a minor child; or
(2) the personal representative of the individual, then follow the
procedure for "Verification of Identity of Those Requesting Protected
Health Information."</p></li>
<li><p>Once the identity of a parent or personal representative is
verified, then follow the procedure for "Individual’s Request for
Access."</p></li>
<li><p>All other requests from spouses, family members, and friends must
be authorized by the individual whose PHI is involved. See the
procedures for "Disclosures Pursuant to Individual
Authorization."</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosures of PHI to Business Associates</strong></p>
<p>Business Associate is an entity that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>performs or assists in performing a Plan function or activity
involving the use and disclosure of protected health information
(including claims processing or administration, data analysis,
underwriting, etc.); or,</p></li>
<li><p>provides legal, accounting, actuarial, consulting, data
aggregation, management, accreditation, or financial services, where the
performance of such services involves giving the service provider access
to PHI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Business Associates include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>health information organizations;</p></li>
<li><p>e-prescribing gateways;</p></li>
<li><p>other entities that provide data transmission services with
respect to PHI and require routine access to PHI;</p></li>
<li><p>entities that offer a personal health record to one or more
individuals on behalf of a covered entity; or</p></li>
<li><p>entities that maintain PHI, whether or not the entities actually
review the PHI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Employees may disclose PHI to Chartr Health’s business associates and
allow the business associates to create or receive PHI on its behalf.
However, prior to doing so, Chartr Health will first obtain assurances
from the business associate that it will appropriately safeguard the
information. All uses and disclosures by a "business associate" will be
made in accordance with a valid business associate agreement. Before
sharing PHI with outside consultants or contractors who meet the
definition of a “business associate,” employees must contact the Privacy
Official and verify that a business associate contract is in place.</p>
<p>The following additional procedures must be satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disclosures must be consistent with the terms of the business
associate contract.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must comply with the "Minimum-Necessary Standard."
(Under that procedure, each recurring disclosure will be subject to a
separate policy to address the minimum-necessary requirement, and each
non-recurring disclosure must be approved by the Privacy
Official.)</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Complying With the “Minimum-Necessary” Standard</strong></p>
<p>HIPAA requires that when PHI is used or disclosed, the amount
disclosed generally must be limited to the “minimum necessary” to
accomplish the purpose of the use or disclosure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Procedures for Disclosures</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify recurring disclosures. For each recurring disclosure,
identify the types of PHI to be disclosed, the types of person who may
receive the PHI, the conditions that would apply to such access, and the
standards for disclosures to routinely-hired types of business
associates. Create a policy for each specific recurring disclosure that
limits the amount disclosed to the minimum amount necessary to
accomplish the purpose of the disclosure.</p></li>
<li><p>For all other requests for disclosures of PHI, contact the
Privacy Official, who will ensure that the amount of information
disclosed is the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the
disclosure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Procedures for Requests</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify recurring requests. For each recurring request, identify
the information that is necessary for the purpose of the requested
disclosure and create a policy that limits each request to the minimum
amount necessary to accomplish the purpose of the disclosure.</p></li>
<li><p>For all other requests for PHI, contact the Privacy Official, who
will ensure the amount of information requested is the minimum necessary
to accomplish the purpose of the disclosure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Exceptions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The "minimum-necessary" standard does not apply to any of the
following:</p></li>
<li><p>Uses or disclosures made to the individual;</p></li>
<li><p>Uses or disclosures made pursuant to an individual
authorization;</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures made to HHS;</p></li>
<li><p>Uses or disclosures required by law; and</p></li>
<li><p>Uses or disclosures required to comply with HIPAA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosures of De-Identified Information</strong></p>
<p>De-identified information is not PHI; it is health information that
does not identify an individual and with respect to which there is no
reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify
an individual. There are two ways to determine that information is
de-identified: either by professional statistical analysis, or by
removing specific identifiers.</p>
<p>Upon approval and verification from the Privacy Official that the
information in question is de-identified, the de-identified information
may be used and disclosed freely in accordance with HIPAA privacy
regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Individual’s Request for Access</strong></p>
<p>HIPAA provides individuals the right to access and obtain copies of
their PHI (or electronic copies of PHI) that Chartr Health (or its
business associates) maintains in designated record sets.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a request from an individual (or from a minor's parent
or an individual's personal representative) for disclosure of an
individual's PHI, the employees will take the following steps:</p>
<p>Follow the procedures for verifying the identity of the individual
(or parent or personal representative) set forth in "Verification of
Identity of Those Requesting Protected Health Information."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Review the disclosure request to determine whether the PHI
requested is held in the individual's designated record set. See the
Privacy Official if it appears that the requested information is not
held in the individual's designated record set. No request for access
may be denied without approval from the Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the disclosure request to determine whether an exception
to the disclosure requirement might exist; for example, disclosure may
be denied for requests to access psychotherapy notes, documents compiled
for a legal proceeding, information compiled during research when the
individual has agree to denial of access, information obtained under a
promise of confidentiality, and other disclosures that are determined by
a health care professional to be likely to cause harm. See the Privacy
Official if there is any question about whether one of these exceptions
applies. No request for access may be denied without approval from the
Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Respond to the request by providing the information or denying
the request within 30 days. If the requested PHI cannot be accessed
within the 30-day period, the deadline may be extended for 30 days by
providing written notice to the individual within the original 30 -day
period of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the
Employer will respond.</p></li>
<li><p>A Denial Notice must contain (1) the basis for the denial; (2) a
statement of the individual's right to request a review of the denial,
if applicable; and (3) a statement of how the individual may file a
complaint concerning the denial. All notices of denial must be prepared
or approved by the Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the information requested in the form or format requested
by the individual, if readily producible in such form. Otherwise,
provide the information in a readable hard copy or such other form as is
agreed to by the individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals have the right to receive a copy by mail or by e-mail
or can come in and pick up a copy. Individuals (including inmates) also
have the right to come in and inspect the information.</p></li>
<li><p>If the individual has requested a summary and explanation of the
requested information in lieu of, or in addition to, the full
information, prepare such summary and explanation of the information
requested and make it available to the individual in the form or format
requested by the individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Charge a reasonable cost-based fee for copying, postage, and
preparing a summary (but the fee for a summary must be agreed to in
advance by the individual). This provision is not needed if the plan
will not charge a fee.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosures must be documented in accordance with the procedure
"Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Individual’s Requests for Amendment</strong></p>
<p>HIPAA also provides individuals the right to request to have their
PHI amended. Chartr Health will consider requests for amendment that are
submitted in writing by participants.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a request from an individual (or a minor's parent or
an individual's personal representative) for amendment of an
individual's PHI held in a designated record set, employees will take
the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the procedures for verifying the identity of the
individual (or parent or personal representative) set forth in
"Verification of Identity of Those Requesting Protected Health
Information."</p></li>
<li><p>Review the disclosure request to determine whether the PHI at
issue is held in the individual's designated record set. See the Privacy
Official if it appears that the requested information is not held in the
individual's designated record set. No request for amendment may be
denied without approval from the Privacy Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the request for amendment to determine whether the
information would be accessible under HIPAA's right to access (see the
access procedures above). See the Privacy Official if there is any
question about whether one of these exceptions applies. No request for
amendment may be denied without approval from the Privacy
Official.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the request for amendment to determine whether the
amendment is appropriate—that is, determine whether the information in
the designated record set is accurate and complete without the
amendment.</p></li>
<li><p>Respond to the request within 60 days by informing the individual
in writing that the amendment will be made or that the request is
denied. If the determination cannot be made within the 60-day period,
the deadline may be extended for 30 days by providing written notice to
the individual within the original 60-day period of the reasons for the
extension and the date by which the Employer will respond.</p></li>
<li><p>When an amendment is accepted, make the change in the designated
record set, and provide appropriate notice to the individual and all
persons or entities listed on the individual's amendment request form,
if any, and also provide notice of the amendment to any persons/entities
who are known to have the particular record and who may rely on the
unconnected information to the detriment of the individual.</p></li>
<li><p>When an amendment request is denied, the following procedures
apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All notices of denial must be prepared or approved by the Privacy
Official. A Denial Notice must contain (1) the basis for the denial; (2)
information about the individual's right to submit a written statement
disagreeing with the denial and how to file such a statement; (3) an
explanation that the individual may (if he or she does not file a
statement of disagreement) request that the request for amendment and
its denial be included in future disclosures of the information; and (4)
a statement of how the individual may file a complaint concerning the
denial.</p></li>
<li><p>If, following the denial, the individual files a statement of
disagreement, include the individual's request for an amendment; the
denial notice of the request; the individual's statement of
disagreement, if any; and the Employer's rebuttal/response to such
statement of disagreement, if any, with any subsequent disclosure of the
record to which the request for amendment relates. If the individual has
not submitted a written statement of disagreement, include the
individual's request for amendment and its denial with any subsequent
disclosure of the protected health information only if the individual
has requested such action.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Request for an Accounting of Disclosures of PHI</strong></p>
<p>An individual has the right to obtain an accounting of certain
disclosures of his or her own PHI.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a request from an individual (or a minor's parent or
an individual's personal representative) for an accounting of
disclosures, the employee must take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the procedures for verifying the identity of the
individual (or parent or personal representative) set forth in
"Verification of Identity of Those Requesting Protected Health
Information."</p></li>
<li><p>If the individual requesting the accounting has already received
one accounting within the 12 month period immediately preceding the date
of receipt of the current request, prepare a notice to the individual
informing him or her that a fee for processing will be charged and
providing the individual with a chance to withdraw the request.</p></li>
<li><p>Respond to the request within 60 days by providing the accounting
(as described in more detail below), or informing the individual that
there have been no disclosures that must be included in an accounting
(see the list of exceptions to the accounting requirement below). If the
accounting cannot be provided within the 60-day period, the deadline may
be extended for 30 days by providing written notice to the individual
within the original 60-day period of the reasons for the extension and
the date by which the Employer will respond.</p></li>
<li><p>The accounting must include disclosures (but not uses) of the
requesting individual's PHI made by Plan and any of its business
associates during the period requested by the individual up to six years
prior to the request. (Note, however, that the plan is not required to
account for any disclosures made prior to April 14, 2004. The accounting
does not have to include disclosures made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to carry out treatment, payment and health care
operations;</p></li>
<li><p>to the individual about his or her own PHI;</p></li>
<li><p>incident to an otherwise permitted use or disclosure;</p></li>
<li><p>pursuant to an individual authorization;</p></li>
<li><p>for specific national security or intelligence purposes;</p></li>
<li><p>to correctional institutions or law enforcement when the
disclosure was permitted without an authorization; and</p></li>
<li><p>as part of a limited data set.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If any business associate of the Plan has the authority to
disclose the individual's PHI, then Privacy Officer shall contact
business associate to obtain an accounting of the business associate's
disclosures.</p></li>
<li><p>The accounting must include the following information for each
reportable disclosure of the individual's PHI:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the date of disclosure;</p></li>
<li><p>the name (and if known, the address) of the entity or person to
whom the information was disclosed;</p></li>
<li><p>a brief description of the PHI disclosed; and</p></li>
<li><p>a brief statement explaining the purpose for the disclosure. (The
statement of purpose may be accomplished by providing a copy of the
written request for disclosure, when applicable.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the Plan has received a temporary suspension statement from a
health oversight agency or a law enforcement official indicating that
notice to the individual of disclosures of PHI would be reasonably
likely to impede the agency's activities, disclosure may not be
required. If an employee receives such a statement, either orally or in
writing, the employee must contact the Privacy Official for more
guidance.</p></li>
<li><p>Accountings must be documented in accordance with the procedure
for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requests for Confidential Communications</strong></p>
<p>Individuals may request to receive communications regarding their PHI
by alternative means or at alternative locations. For example,
participants may ask to be called only at work rather than at home. Such
requests may be honored if the requests are reasonable.</p>
<p>However, the Employer shall accommodate such a request if the
participant clearly provides information that the disclosure of all or
part of that information could endanger the participant. The Privacy
Official has responsibility for administering requests for confidential
communications.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a request from an individual (or a minor's parent or
an individual's personal representative) to receive communications of
PHI by alternative means or at alternative locations, the employee must
take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the procedures for verifying the identity of the
individual (or parent or personal representative) set forth in
"Verification of Identity of Those Requesting Protected Health
Information."</p></li>
<li><p>Determine whether the request contains a statement that
disclosure of all or part of the information to which the request
pertains could endanger the individual.</p></li>
<li><p>The employee should take steps to honor requests.</p></li>
<li><p>If a request will not be accommodated, the employee must contact
the individual in person, in writing, or by telephone to explain why the
request cannot be accommodated.</p></li>
<li><p>All confidential communication requests that are approved must be
tracked.</p></li>
<li><p>Requests and their dispositions must be documented in accordance
with the procedure for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requests for Restrictions on Uses and Disclosures of
PHI</strong></p>
<p>Individuals may request restrictions on the use and disclosure of the
participant's PHI. Upon receiving a request from an individual (or a
minor's parent or an individual's personal representative) for access to
an individual's PHI, the employee must take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the procedures for verifying the identity of the
individual (or parent or personal representative) set forth in
"Verification of Identity of Those Requesting Protected Health
Information."</p></li>
<li><p>The employee should take steps to honor requests.</p></li>
<li><p>If a request will not be accommodated, the employee must contact
the individual in person, in writing, or by telephone to explain why the
request cannot be accommodated.</p></li>
<li><p>All requests for limitations on use or disclosure of PHI that are
approved must be tracked.</p></li>
<li><p>All business associates that may have access to the individual's
PHI must be notified of any agreed-to restrictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Requests and their dispositions must be documented in accordance
with the procedure for "Documentation Requirements."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Records</strong></p>
<p>Copies of all of the following items will be maintained for a period
of at least six years from the date the documents were created or were
last in effect, whichever is later:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Notices of Privacy Practices" that are issued to
participants</p></li>
<li><p>Copies of policies and procedures</p></li>
<li><p>Individual authorizations</p></li>
<li><p>When disclosure of certain PHI is made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Date of the disclosure;</p></li>
<li><p>Name of the entity or person who received the PHI and, if known,
the address of such entity or person;</p></li>
<li><p>Brief description of the PHI disclosed;</p></li>
<li><p>Brief statement of the purpose of the disclosure; and</p></li>
<li><p>Any other documentation required under these Use and Disclosure
Procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
